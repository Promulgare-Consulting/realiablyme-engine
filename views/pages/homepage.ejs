              We use blockchain technology to register and track social contracts as digital promises (IOUs) in order to generate Social Credit Scores that can be used as an indicator of creditworthiness and employability.

            <p class="text-muted">
              Alex Todd, the Founder and CEO of Trust 2 Pay, and global thought leader on diagnosing and designing conditions for trust, has identified a new possibility to improve global prosperity with emerging blockchain technologies.

              “Employers, landlords, lenders, and insurers discriminate against the majority of the world’s population with onerous guarantee requirements, simply because they are underemployed or underbanked.

              We will help everyone demonstrate their reliability and true worth by allowing them to earn a Social Credit Brand as they fulfill everyday commitments to help and reciprocate favours.”
